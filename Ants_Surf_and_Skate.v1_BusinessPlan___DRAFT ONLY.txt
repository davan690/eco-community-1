Ants Surf & Skate Shop,
℅: The Statistics Network,
Unit 10,
271 Antill Street,
Watson, Canberra, 
ACT, Australia.
`
This report is compiled by “The Statistics Network” (SN) as a pilot project to understand the scope for future collaboration between small businesses in Australisian and research institutions (through statistical applications). Our vision is to use the statistical reporting tools commonly applied in scientific applications and teaching in universities to inform small businesses. 


The pilot report uses real small business data generated by my own personal small business (Ants Surf&Skate Company). I have used this data as an example of how everyday data (information) and big data (generally speaking from the internet) can provide useful insights for even the smallest local start-ups. Within the report, I first provide a demographic understanding of the suburb where “Ants Surf&Skate Company” is located for trading purposes. The data presented in this section is developed using one of the first “Statistics Network” templates.


As I continue to develop “The Statistics Network” these reports will extend to shiny applications (data visualisation that will allow the user to modify the output through a simple web-browser (see example here in the future!).
Thanks for your time,






Anthony Davidson

Business Plan
Business statement (Company Overview)
This local ACT business buys and sells second-hand surfing and skateboarding equipment. We are a small start-up with low overheads. We keep our overheads low by collaborating with exsisting businesses. We further strengthened these links by reducing the time lag between tertiery research outputs and small business.


We will have limited but accessible hours at this location in an aim to sell Secondhand surfboards and gear to both foot traffic and social media platforms (Insta and Facebook). The data presented in this report has also been used as part of the decision making processes during the set-up and day-to-day running of the surf shop. 


 We make coffee from 7am at Siam Twist (@siamtwist) and the surfboards will be out from Thursday - Saturday till Christmas. Come by and have a coffee and chat surfing/skating.

“We are the only Canberra surf and/or skate shop that buys and sells second-hand gear. We stock a wide range of beginner to intermediate boards as well as “pro” gear at affordable rates.”


Project goals
This project is focused around building a small business in conjunction with the statistical support provided by the statistics network from the 1st November 2018 till the 24th December 2018. By using the statistics network we are able to show how through community structure we are able to provide economic stavility. Additionally, I have contructed the economic structure (see Mana) that will allow this within companies that work along side the statistics network.

Market Analysis 
        
Coming soon….


[For this project we have not had sufficient time to do an full in-depth market analysis however into the future we hope that this will be possible for all projects. Additional to this, by collecting and analysis some of the data available for the Hackett suburb in the reproducible format the Statistics Network uses means that any additional analysis will reduce in time and subsequent cost.]
Competition 
One of our key strengths is that there is little competition within the community for surfboards. However, there is significant competition in the regional and international markets for new and secondhand boards. In Australia the profit margin on new boards is often very low ($300 wholesale for $349-399 retail hearsay from one shop).


This competition highlights the fact that we are focused on local advertising and local marketing. To meet the statistics network aims we will use statistics and data to help drive this.


Competition is distance and ……

Appendix eleven:.Results
 The suburb of Hackett is situated in the state of ACT in Australia. From 2016 census data it is possible to draw a very broad understanding of the demography of the area.
  







Figure 1: [Webpage screenshot of basic demographic data of the Hackett suburb. See: http://quickstats.censusdata. abs.gov.au/census_ services/getproduct/census /2016/quickstat/SSC80068












  



Figure 2: [Webpage screenshot of basic demographic data of the Bruce suburb. See: http://quickstats.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/CED205 


 If we are to compare Hackett for example with Bruce (Figure 2) we see that there is a considerable difference in the median monthly income. Now this is likely to be to do with the student component of the Bruce suburb (a issue of confounding effects).


For this project I have written a simple survey for customers to do well waiting for there coffee or surfboard stuff. This is a way of making a database of Canberra Surfers and to assess what the needs of the community are. This will be done by simply collecting the data used for research and marketing.
